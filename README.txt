Description: 
This program implements a workflow pipeline for short read length
sequencing analysis, including the read mapping task, through to variant
detection, followed by analyses (SNPs only).

It uses Rubra (https://github.com/bjpop/rubra) based on the
Ruffus library.

It supports parallel evaluation of independent pipeline stages,
and can run stages on a cluster environment.

Note: for Illumina paired-end or single reads, or Ion Torrent single reads.
IMPORTANT: See config file/instructions for input options/requirements
