simple check of the constructed BAM:
For PE reads, if the BAM is not larger or equal to the size of
one of the read sets (_1), the BAM is deleted and an error code returned
For SE and IT reads, if the BAM is less than half the size of the read set,
the BAM is deleted and an error code returned - this should stop the pipeline!

otherwise, nothing happens...

example:
python checkBam.py <bam> <read_type> <sequence_mapped> 

[only need one of the pair for PE reads]
